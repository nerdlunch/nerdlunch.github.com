What is Nerd Lunch?
-------------------

A Nerd Lunch is just a simple gathering of like-minded individuals to eat food,
drink beverages and discuss something nerdy, geeky or weird. Each Nerd Lunch is
unique. However, the goal is to have a friendly discussion over a meal.

Do we have to hold a Nerd Lunch at lunch time?
----------------------------------------------

No. A Nerd Lunch can be held at any time. It just tends to be most beneficial
during the lunch hour. This is a good time for nerds to escape the office for
an hour or so to discuss things of great passion and interest.
