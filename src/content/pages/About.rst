Welcome to http://NerdLun.ch, the place to find out about cool nerdy and
geeky lunch events in your town. Nerd Lunch is here to help create,
organize and find lunch events for any nerdy or geeky interest.

Attend a Nerd Lunch
-------------------

On the `main page <http://nerdlun.ch/>`_ is a list of cities that are
currently holding a regular Nerd Lunch. We check this list periodically
to ensure it's as accurate as possible. If you are interested in attending,
click the link, join the mailing list or view the calendar to find the 
latest on the Nerd Lunch near you!

Make Your Own Nerd Lunch
-------------------------

To make your own Nerd Lunch, just fork this site and add your page. We use
`Pelican <http://getpelican.com/>`_ to generate the site, so it's easy to
use. More information is available `here <pages/create_a_lunch>`_.
